\section{Introduction}

This is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language)}{Karel language environment},
simplified, and gamified in an attempt to make it more intriguing for complete beginners.

The game is about a robot, Karla, who is lost in a building, and needs help to get
out. The player needs to guide Karla through a series of rooms, guiding her to the
exist in each room. The tasks are getting progressively more challenging, obviously.

The URL for the game is:
\begin{center}
\href{http://karla.lahoda.info/}{http://karla.lahoda.info/}
\end{center}

\section{General Recommendations}

Read the description at the top for each room. It sets up the scene, and also contain
a hint on how to solve the task at hand.

The game is based on \href{https://blockly.games/}{Blockly}, creating the commands
should not be surprising.

Note the main command for each room is pre-created. It is not necessary (although
permitted) to create new commands.

There is "Karla's speed" knob under the Karla's room display. It can be used to speed
up Karla, which is handy in the later rooms, where the commands become more complex.

\subsection{Changing Language}

At the very bottom, there is \texttt{Language} button. Click on it, it will expand
to show Czech, Greek and English. Note that changing the language will reset the game
state (see blow).

\subsection{Resolving problems}

If the program for a given room does not guide Karla to the exit, option to "Give
Up" is given, which will delete whatever code was provided for the current room's
command with a canonical known-working version.

If bigger problems occur, one solution is to hard-reload the page (which will reset
the game). To avoid the need to go through all the rooms again, there is \texttt{Show
admin commands} button at the bottom. Clicking on it will show a clickable list of rooms,
clicking at the room will jump into that room, creating any non-existent commands
along the way as needed.

Please note that jumping to a specific room this will not change \emph{existing} commands,
even if they are empty! So if jumping to a room further down the line, please make
sure the command for the current room is either deleted, or filled fully (e.g. using
the "Give Up" button).

It is also possible to clear all the existing commands by using \texttt{Show admin commands/Clear All Commands}.
Jumping to any room should be safe after clearing the commands.

\section{Important Rooms}

\subsection{Room 1}

In this room, there is no command to be declared/filled. There are "step" and "left-turn"
commands, which should be used to manually guide Karla to exit:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{step-left_en}\\
English commands\\
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{step-left_el}\\
Greek commands
\end{center}

\subsection{Rooms 2 and 3}

In these rooms, the command does need to move Karla to the exist, just rotate Karla
so that she's facing the exit. It can be used to show the power of dividing more complex
tasks into smaller ones: in Room 2, create \texttt{turn-back} command as \texttt{turn left} and
\texttt{turn left}. In Room 3, \texttt{turn-right} can be declared as \texttt{turn-back}
and\texttt{turn left}.

\subsection{Room 4}

Starting in these rooms, Karla mus tbe guided to stand at the exit, not just to face
it.

\subsection{Room 7}

Starting with this room, there is a sequence of 3 rooms that Karla must pass with
the same program. It is no longer possible to pre-create the path, tests and/or loops
must be used.

\subsection{Room 11}

Karla is out of the building, congratulations! This is the end of the game!
